<h1>About</h1>
Hi! I'm Jon Morgan and I'm a Computer Science student at City, Universiy of London. I love programming small projects, hacking hardware, researching computing, and playing computer games. I have a passion for running, and have been getting back into cycling more recently.
<br>
Python is my main language, but I also use a bit of JS for frontends, and I'm learning Java as part of my uni course!
<br>
Thanks for visiting my website, I hope I can provide something you find interesting.
