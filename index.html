<h1>About</h1>
Hi! I'm Jon Morgan and I'm a Computer Science student at City, Universiy of London. I love programming small projects, hacking hardware, researching computing, and playing computer games. I have a passion for running, and have been getting back into cycling and swimming more recently, and I also have an interest in geography and social sciences, hence I enjoy playing with geographical or civil data.

Thanks for visiting my website, I hope I can provide something you find interesting.
