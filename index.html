<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Hi! I'm Jon Morgan, I'm a Software Developer and I study Computer Science at City, Universiy of London. I love programming small projects, hacking hardware, researching computing, and playing computer games. I also like running kind of fast & cycling in pretty places.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently working in the retail technology sector learning lots about software development throughout the stack, and software engineering in general.
</p>
<p>
  My main area of knowledge is in C#, and have recently been experimenting working on .NET core applications & learning about how to deploy these with Azure. Additionally, I have built a strong knowledge of Python and Java, both through personal projects and university.
</p>
<p>
  I also have some experience with front-end development, so I know my way around JavaScript, but I find TypeScript to be very exciting and I'm pretty sure it's the future.
