Imagine being a point. As a point, you feel like all the sides are out to get you. Then you realise you're existing within a shape and you can only move in two directions. Welcome to the world of Super Hexagon.

In my first two weeks of university, I built a clone of Super Hexagon using Processing. All students had to create something over the two weeks to demonstrate the skills they had learnt. This acted as an introduction to programming in Java, since Processing is built atop Java but makes it easy to learn vital programming concepts.

You could say I have an addiction to the original game. I've put in over 30 hours of play time to the simple geometric twitch/reflex based game, and due to its simple premise, it only made sense for me to recreate it when given the chance to make something fun.

The game is very similar, however it has many creases due to the time limitation of the project. For example, I initially only planned for one difficulty, so adding the menu and difficulty selection was somewhat bodged on. I only thought of including the leaderboard the evening before the project was due, so its implementation is not as clean or safe as it could be. 

Another problem you may notice is that the game does not include patterns of obstacles like the original does. I would have liked to add these, but hadn't planned on doing it from the beginning, so trying to add structure to how obstacles were spawned proved to be very challenging. If I were to create it again, I would keep this in mind and use better OOP practices to form obstacles.

My version of the game can be found [on my GitHub](https://github.com/Jmorjsm/Decent-Hexajon), so please feel free to give it a go. However if you do enjoy the game, please support the original developer and purchase the game. I assure you, it is much better than my clone, and can be purchased on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221640/), [iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/super-hexagon/id549027629?ls=1&mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.distractionware.superhexagon), [Blackberry](http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/22507872/), or from [the official website](http://superhexagon.com/).
You will not regret your purchase.
