description: A few little experiments I've been working on recently in p5.js
---

<p>
  Here I've got a few little experiments I've been working on using p5.js, the JavaScript counterpart to Processing.

  <h2>Motion painting</h2>
  <p>
    The below sketch is my first endeavour into motion tracking, inspired heavily by <a
      href="https://twitter.com/mayaonthenet">Maya Man</a>'s beautiful <a
      href="https://mayaontheinter.net/paintme/">paint me</a> art pieces.
  </p>
  <p>
    I determine which pixels have changed by looping through a downsized version of the previous frame and comparing the
    "distances" between the colours of each pixel. Pixels with larger distances are repainted with higher opacity so
    those that have not changed much stay trasparent and effectively invisible.

  <h2>Edge detection</h2>
  <p>
    This sketch demonstrates a common method used for edge detection using the Sobel operator. I learned most of the
    theory behind this sketch from Dr Mike Pound's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uihBwtPIBxM">videos on
      Computerphile.</a>
  </p>

    Put simply, the code looks at the surrounding 9 pixels of each pixel in the image and multiplies the left and right,
    and above and below pixels by 1 or -1 and adds all these values up to determine the level of change betin the
    horizontal and vertical directions. This is then mapped into a greyscale value and displayed on the screen.
