I use this site to document side projects I work on, and hopefully help others with programming in some way.

Thanks for checking it out!

The site is being hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) which is extremely convenient as I can just push changes and they are instantly updated. It also allows me to use the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator to create content for individual posts or pages, as well as provide metadata about these pages so they can be categorised, as you can see on this website. 

For more info about how I've done this, look at the [source code](https://github.com/Jmorjsm/jmorjsm.github.io/), or feel free to contact me for further clarification.

On top of this I am using the CloudFlare CDN and DNS services to provide super fast page loads and cacheing, as well as protection against any attacks.
